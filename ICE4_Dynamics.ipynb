    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{x}=f(x)+g(u)=Ax+Bu$$\n",

    "\n",
    "However, Nengo neurons have their own inherent feed forward dynamics: $\\dot{x(t)}=-\\frac{1}{\\tau}(x(t))-u(t))$. These dynamics tell us that $x_{new} = x_{old}+\\dot{x}$, where $x_{new}$ is the output of our neuron ensemble and $\\dot{x}$ is the input to our ensemble (draw block diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the neuron ensemble to behave in the way a typical linear dynamical system behaves - i.e. $\\dot{x}=f(x)+g(u)=Ax+Bu$ - we must define different functions $f'$ and $g'$.

    "### Two Integrators in Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In `neuron_dynamics.ipynb`, we converted a 1-D velocity signal $v$ into position $p$ using an integrator. Given that $\\dot{p}(t)=v(t)$ (i.e. derivative of position is velocity), it should make sense that with each time step, we move toward a position (our output in meters) at some velocity (our input in m/s). \n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the inherent neuron dynamics to typicaly control dynamics, we defined functions for our feed forward and feedback aspects of our recurrent network for an integrator to be:\n",

    "$$f'(x)= \\tau f(x) + x = \\tau Ax + x = x$$\n",
    "$$g'(u)=\\tau g(u)  =\\tau Bu = \\tau Iu =\\tau u$$ \n",

    "Intuitively, this should make sense. Each time step, our new position $p$ is equal to dynamics $p = f' + g' = x + \\tau u$ where $x$ is our output state $x$ and $u$ is our input velocity. If our velocity is 1m/s and we run our simulation for 1 second, we should move 1 meter total. However, we have many time steps within that 1 second, so we move a fraction of 1m each time step - you can think of $\\tau$ as the scale term, i.e. how quickly we respond to the input velocity.\n",

    "For this example, we will connect the integrator we created in `neuron_dynamics.ipynb` to an identical integrator. The final output of the network is position $p$ (i.e. the output of the second neuron ensemble), and the input to that ensemble is velocity (i.e. $\\dot{p}$). We connect an neuron ensemble to the front end, from which the output is velocity (give that's the input to the second ensemble). That means the input to the first ensemble (and therefore entire network) is.... acceleration ($\\dot{v}$)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our input acceleration is a piecewise function so you can see that the output is integrating (i.e. summing over time) the input. If we have a constant acceleration, we should see velocity ramp up. Recall, for a constant velocity, we have position ramp up. This time, with a velocity changing over time, we should see position change faster for higher velocities - so we should _not_ see a straight line output from the network. Let's give it a go:"

That's 1D and our neuron ensemble is 2D, which means we need a matrix that converts our 1D acceleration to a 2D input.  Therefore, matrix $B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Why?? Because our output $x$ is equal to $\\begin{bmatrix} p \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix}$ and in our integrator, our input $u=\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{p} \\\\ \\dot{v} \\end{bmatrix}$. We do not have an input velocity, only an input acceleration. Given $a=\\dot{v}$, we get $B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.  \n",

    "- Negative velocity moves you in a negative direction. If you start with positive acceleration, changing it to negative gradually gets you to a negative velocity (because it does not instantaneously change from positive to negative - you should have seen that in your last two plots). _Your direction will not change until your velocity is negative!_\n",
    "- Your neurons will drift (you can try this out by putting in zero acceleration and seeing what happens to velocity and position... it's bad!). This is real-world stuff! Kalman filters help us know where we are in between GPS signals and require feedback just like our neurons. Not only are you feeding back signal, but you are also feeding back noise and/or error (also much like our neurons - think through our noisy plots!). Said noise/error only grows over time as it continues to be fed back in and accumulate. This is the definition of drift - you are drifting away from your actual position - in this case, 0.  Even if you aren't wanting to move in a particular direction (yet), it might be wise to try to stabilize your dynamics using a small input in a particular direction you know you might be using soon. Such as... I know I want my vehicle to head north in a few seconds, so I'll start it off with a super small positive number (instead of zero) to make sure it's heading in the right direction when it's time. Note: this will bias your signal when you try to send your velocity back to zero (next hint). \n",
    "- To make a 90 degree turn, if you already have movement in the y direction (north), you'll need to pump the breaks hard to quickly turn right (east) -- just like driving! That way you aren't continuously moving north with velocity greater than 0 (per the last hint) while trying to actually move east . You need your velocity to get back to zero in the north direction to change your direction to east.\n",

    "**Your plots will not look the same twice, ever! But it should be clear that you're making the correct turns with your \"vehicle\" the majority of the time.** This is due to noise and initial neuron parameters. Think through what your velocity plots should look like (in terms of shape).
